## What is sknnr?

`sknnr` is a package for running k-nearest neighbor (kNN) imputation[^imputation] methods using estimators that are fully compatible with [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Notably, common methods such as most similar neighbor (MSN, Moeur & Stage 1995), gradient nearest neighbor (GNN, Ohmann & Gregory, 2002), and random forest nearest neighbors (RFNN, Crookston & Finley, 2008) are included in this package.

## Features

- 🤝 Tight integration with the [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) API
- 🐼 Native support for [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes
- 📊 [Multi-output](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html) estimators for [regression and classification](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#regression-and-classification)
- 📝 Results validated against [yaImpute](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaImpute/index.html) (Crookston & Finley 2008)[^validation]

## Why the Name "sknnr"?

`sknnr` is an acronym of its main three components:

1. **"s"** is for `scikit-learn`. All estimators in this package derive from the `sklearn.BaseEstimator` class and comply with the requirements associated with [developing custom estimators](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html).
2. **"knn"** is for k-nearest neighbors. All estimators use the _k_ >= 1 samples that are nearest in feature space to create their prediction. Each estimator in this package defines that feature space in a different way which often leads to different neighbors chosen for the prediction.
3. **"r"** is for regression. Estimators in this package are run in [regression mode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html). For nearest neighbor imputation, this is simply an (optionally-weighted) average of its _k_ neighbors. When _k_ is set to 1, this effectively behaves as in [classification mode](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html). All estimators support multi-output prediction so that multiple features can be predicted with the same estimator.

## Quick-Start

1. Follow the [installation guide](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation).
2. Import any `sknnr` estimator, like [MSNRegressor](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/estimators/msn), as a drop-in replacement for a `scikit-learn` regressor.
```python
from sknnr import MSNRegressor

est = MSNRegressor()
```
3. Load a custom dataset like [SWO Ecoplot](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/datasets/swo_ecoplot) (or bring your own).
```python
from sknnr.datasets import load_swo_ecoplot

X, y = load_swo_ecoplot(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
```
4. Train, predict, and score [as usual](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html#fitting-and-predicting-estimator-basics).
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

est = est.fit(X_train, y_train)
est.score(X_test, y_test)
```
5. Check out the additional features like [independent scoring](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#independent-scores-and-predictions), [dataframe indexing](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#retrieving-dataframe-indexes), and [dimensionality reduction](https://sknnr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#dimensionality-reduction).
```python
# Evaluate the model using the second-nearest neighbor in the test set
print(est.fit(X, y).independent_score_)

# Get the dataframe index of the nearest neighbor to each plot
print(est.kneighbors(return_dataframe_index=True, return_distance=False))

# Apply dimensionality reduction using CCorA ordination
MSNRegressor(n_components=3).fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## History and Inspiration
`sknnr` was heavily inspired by (and endeavors to implement functionality of) the [yaImpute](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaImpute/index.html) package for R (Crookston & Finley 2008).  As Crookston and Finley (2008) note in their abstract,
> Although nearest neighbor imputation is used in a host of disciplines, the methods implemented in the yaImpute package are tailored to imputation-based forest attribute estimation and mapping ... [there is] a growing interest in nearest neighbor imputation methods for spatially explicit forest inventory, and a need within this research community for software that facilitates comparison among different nearest neighbor search algorithms and subsequent imputation techniques.

Indeed, many regional (e.g. [LEMMA](https://lemmadownload.forestry.oregonstate.edu/)) and national (e.g. [BIGMAP](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c710684b98f54452804e8960d37905b2), [TreeMap](https://www.firelab.org/project/treemap-tree-level-model-forests-united-states)) projects use nearest-neighbor methods to
estimate and map forest attributes across time and space.

To that end, `sknnr` ports and expands the functionality present in `yaImpute` into a Python package that helps facilitate intercomparison between k-nearest neighbor methods (and other built-in estimators from `scikit-learn`) using an API which is familiar to `scikit-learn` users.

[^imputation]: In a mapping context, kNN imputation refers to predicting feature values for a target from its k-nearest neighbors, and should not be confused with the usual `scikit-learn` usage as a pre-filling strategy for missing input data, e.g. [`KNNImputer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.KNNImputer.html).
[^validation]: All estimators and parameters with equivalent functionality in `yaImpute` are tested to 3 decimal places against the R package. Because of implementation differences between R's `randomForest` package and scikit-learn's `RandomForestRegressor`, the RFNN estimator is not directly comparable to the `yaImpute` implementation. However, in porting RFNN to `sknnr`, we ensured that we obtained equivalent output when using R's `randomForest` through `rpy2`.
